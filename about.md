We are a collective of opinionated Indonesian software developer who one day decided to collectively write about tech stuff. The main purpose is to organize our thought and documenting knowledge which can be used as refference for our peers.

Most of us worked together in a tech company which better to be put as nameless company due to security issues. However, we think that writing tech blog is a good practice, so we go for it using more neutral name.

Our tech team care about 'not being a jerk' and 'help find a role for everybody to fit in'.

Our tech team care about what makes a good software and aim for that while still put 'faster delivery' as a top priority.

Our tech team care about 'battery included' philosophy, which in project management context translated to 'providing motivation and productivity encouragement from top down' instead of blindly giving a task and deadline to team members.

Our teach team care about providing time for pet project aimed for research purpose.

If you are curious and want to be part of our small team, working in Jakarta, reach us at:
